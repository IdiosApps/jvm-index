## Usage

Generate an index with
```bash
$ GH_TOKEN="****" ./generate-index.sh
```

Just `./generate-index.sh` can work if `GH_TOKEN` is not set, but it usually
gets rate-limited by the GitHub API.

By default, the index is written in `index.json` in the current directory.
Pass `--output custom.json` to write to another file.

## (Non) use by coursier

The index generated here *could* be used by the `java` and `java-home`
commands of [coursier](https://get-coursier.io), but it's not yet.

coursier currently relies on the [index](https://github.com/shyiko/jabba/blob/master/index.json)
from the [jabba project](https://github.com/shyiko/jabba), which is
regularly updated.

The index generated by the script here could either complement, or replace
if needed, the index from jabba at some point.
